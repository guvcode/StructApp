## 10.9 Decisions Made During Build

* **(post-v2 amendment)** ADR-007 amended: PDF generation library changed from Puppeteer to **PDFKit** — avoids shipping Chromium in the deployment image; design tokens no longer flow automatically into the PDF.
* **(post-v2 amendment)** ADR-008 amended: email provider changed from SendGrid to **Resend**; SMS provider changed from Twilio to **MessageBird**. The `NotificationProvider` interface is unchanged.
* **(v3)** ADR-011 added: recurrence is modeled as `recurrence_interval_days INT` (fixed interval), not full RRULE/iCal calendar rules. Re-evaluate in a future sprint if a real calendar-rule requirement surfaces.
* **(v3)** Client portal is out of scope. Clients receive PDF/Word/Excel deliverables via email or signed download link.
* **(v3)** Multi-inspector per inspection is out of scope. Per-asset independent assignment is sufficient.
* **(v3, post-amendment)** Reviewer role was promoted to global/cross-tenant. The audit log is now Admin-and-Reviewer allowed; Contractor tokens still receive `403`. `client_memberships` is now Contractor-only. `POST /auth/switch-client` is now Admin-and-Reviewer allowed.
* **(v3, post-amendment)** `POST /auth/switch-client` was further extended to Contractor — they can switch between clients they hold a membership for, without logging out. Server validates against `client_memberships` and returns `403 NOT_A_MEMBER` otherwise. The PWA app bar / desktop top-right surfaces only the Contractor's own memberships (defense in depth, not the primary filter).
* **(v3, post-amendment)** Photo cap raised from 5 to 20 with soft UI warning at 6. The DB trigger `enforce_max_five_photos` + `trg_enforce_max_photos` are dropped. API-layer constant `MAX_PHOTOS_PER_DEFICIENCY = 20`. Soft warning starts at 6. Amendment note in v2 §0 row 17.
* **(v3, post-amendment)** FR-3.2 "Post-Inspection Manual Entry" is replaced by FR-16. The new rule is inspector-declared `onsite` vs `post_inspection` mode at the start of every inspection; in `post_inspection` mode the PWA does not call the Geolocation API for any deficiency.
* **(v3)** FR-14 (PIN fallback) added: per-user 6-digit access PIN, set at profile setup, no expiry. After 3 failed password attempts, `/login` surfaces the PIN entry. PIN-mode token is read-only and offline-only; new data goes to `pin_outbox` and is held locally until real-password login. Argon2id hashing. Residual limitation: device must reach a network area for the PIN itself to be verified server-side.
* **(v3)** FR-17 (pre-inspection timesheet flag) added: server auto-derives `pre_inspection = true` on timesheet entries logged before the inspection date. Yellow left-border + "Logged before inspection date" tag in the UI. No other effect.
* **(v3, MOD-419)** `processSyncPush` reads `inspection_mode` (changed `SELECT 1` to `SELECT inspection_mode`) but never rejects based on GPS+mode mismatch — enforcement is purely frontend (MOD-418 hook)
* **(v3, MOD-419)** `getPendingDeficiencies()` fixed to serialize full deficiency payload (description, severity, GPS, etc.) instead of only `client_local_id`
* **(v3, MOD-419)** `structureId` added to Dexie `DeficiencyRecord` type to satisfy the sync contract requirement
* **(v3)** `jwt-decode` import fixed from default import to named import (`{ jwtDecode }`) — v4 has no default export
* **(v3)** `refreshResult.access_token` fixed to `refreshResult.data.access_token` in sync refresh flow
* **(post-amendment, post-MOD-419)** `deficiencySyncSchema` already has `gps_latitude`/`gps_longitude` as `.nullable()` — no contract change needed; `processSyncPush` already accepts null GPS in both modes
* **(v3, post-amendment)** `POST /users/:id/resend-invite` and `/revoke-invite` endpoints added (FR-15.3).
* **(v3, post-amendment)** `POST /users/:id/reset-password` admin-path endpoint added (FR-15.3). Admin sets a temporary password; user must change on next login.
* **(v3, post-amendment)** Edit-while-Approved policy: no shortcut endpoint. Reopen → edit → re-approve is the only path (FR-15.2).
* **(v3, post-amendment)** Single-URL / responsive-UI / one-issuer model: one web app at one URL, responsive layout, all roles. JWT `iss: 'structapp-app'` (was split between `structapp-field` and `structapp-desktop`). Reviewer and Admin can both call `POST /auth/switch-client`; Contractor can call it limited to their memberships.
* **(v3, post-amendment)** TanStack Query is the only data-fetching primitive for Client Components; `useEffect` for fetching is banned (04-…md §4.7a).
* **(v3, post-amendment)** Sentry captures frontend errors; pino captures backend errors; `system_job_errors` table stores retry-exhausted jobs and PWA client errors. PII policy: `user_id` UUID only (never email/phone/JWT/GPS), enforced via `beforeSend` scrubber. Backend has no third-party error reporting.

## 10.10 Notes

* Risk priority score bands (80/45/20/8) in `shared/utils/riskCalculator.ts` are a starting heuristic, not a certified engineering standard — must be validated by the structural engineering lead before production.
* Retention period for inspection records and photos is a policy decision, not an engineering one — default to "retain indefinitely, no auto-deletion" until legal/compliance signs off.
* Phone numbers and GPS coordinates are sensitive but not currently column-encrypted — apply `pgcrypto` additively if required by jurisdiction.
* The illustrative `generic_audit_log()` function in v2 §5 must be cloned per audited table with the correct PK column before Sprint 0 hardening.
* **Library additions during v3 review:** `argon2` (PIN hashing), `resend` (email — replaces SendGrid), `messagebird` (SMS — replaces Twilio), `pdfkit` (PDF — replaces Puppeteer), `docx` (Word, unchanged), `exceljs` (Excel, unchanged), `@tanstack/react-query` (client-side data fetching), `@sentry/react` (frontend error reporting). All added to `library-docs.md` "Approved Dependencies".
* **PII to scrub from Sentry:** any field matching `/^[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+$/` (email), `/^\+[1-9]\d{1,14}$/` (E.164 phone), `/^Bearer /` or `/^eyJ/` (JWT), or `/\-?\d{1,3}\.\d{4,}/` (GPS coordinate). Enforced in `beforeSend` hook in code, not just Sentry project settings.
* **Error codes (HTTP status → `error_code`):**
  - `422 PIN_FALLBACK_PHOTO_REQUIRED` / `MISSING_REMEDIATION_EVIDENCE` — verify-closure without `remediation_evidence` photo
  - `423 LOCKED_PIN_FALLBACK_ACTIVE` — write/refresh attempted on a PIN-fallback token
  - `429 PIN_LOCKED_OUT` — 5 failed PIN attempts in an hour, 1-hour lockout
  - `409 INSPECTION_APPROVED_USE_REOPEN` — reassign or bulk-reassign attempted on an Approved inspection
  - `413 BULK_REASSIGN_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` — bulk-reassign with > 100 inspections
  - `422 TARGET_INSPECTOR_INVALID` — target is not an active member of the active client
  - `422 SOURCE_EQUALS_TARGET` — self-reassign attempted
  - `409 MODE_LOCKED_DEFICIENCIES_EXIST` — Admin tried to change `inspection_mode` after the first deficiency was logged
  - `403 NOT_A_MEMBER` — Contractor tried to switch-client to a client they don't hold membership for
  - `403 FORBIDDEN_ADMIN_ONLY` — Reviewer attempted the Reopen endpoint (or any Admin-only endpoint)
  - `409 QR_CODE_ALREADY_IN_USE` — `PATCH /structures/:id qr_code_value` collision
  - `401 RESET_TOKEN_CONSUMED` — second use of a password-reset token
* **`auditEdit` helper signature (pinned):** `auditEdit(pool, { actorUserId, tableName, recordId, action, oldValues, newValues })`. Called inside the same transaction as the data write. The `source_ip` is read from `current_setting('app.request_source_ip', true)`. Cosmetic edits do not call this helper.
* **JWT one-issuer:** all tokens share `iss: 'structapp-app'`, `aud: 'structapp-api'`. The role claim is the only authorization signal in the token; the surface (phone vs laptop) is irrelevant.
* **TanStack Query defaults (pinned):** `staleTime: 30_000` (30s), `gcTime: 5 * 60_000` (5m), `retry: 2` (exponential backoff), `refetchOnWindowFocus: true` for inspection and deficiency data, `false` for picklists and reference data. Query keys are arrays, scoped to the resource and filter args.
* **Argon2id parameters (pinned):** `timeCost: 3, memoryCost: 65536, parallelism: 4`. Verification must take ≥ 250ms on target hardware. The test suite asserts this to catch a future parameter change.
* **`system_job_errors` columns (pinned):** `error_id UUID`, `job_id UUID` (nullable for client errors), `job_type VARCHAR(100)`, `error_code VARCHAR(100)`, `error_message TEXT`, `error_stack TEXT` (truncated to 8KB), `attempt_count INT`, `last_attempted_at TIMESTAMPTZ`, `input_payload JSONB` (nullable), `dismissed_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL`, `dismissed_by UUID NULL REFERENCES users(user_id)`. Visible to Admin and Reviewer in a "Job errors" tab in the same screen that shows `system_audit_logs`.
* **Migration convention (post-v3 review):** FR-15 features (PIN columns, inspection mode enum, timesheet `entry_date` + `pre_inspection`, new tables) are additive `ALTER` migrations on top of the v2 schema — never rewritten `CREATE TABLE` statements. See v2 §5.1 amendment notes for the live examples.

## 10.11 Bug List

| Bug ID | Area | Page / Component | Description | Severity | Reported | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BUG-001 | Inspections | `InspectionListPage.tsx` | Status filter buttons on the page work correctly, but sidebar submenu navigation (`/inspections?status=Submitted`, `?status=Returned`, `?status=Approved`) passes query params that the page never reads. Page initializes `statusFilter` to `'all'` via `useState('all')` — needs `useSearchParams` to sync initial state from URL. | High | 2026-06-26 | 🟩 COMPLETED |
| BUG-002 | Remediation | `RemediationQueuePage.tsx` | Status filter buttons on the page work correctly, but sidebar submenu navigation (`/remediation?status=Open`, `?status=Remediated_Pending_Verification`, `?status=Verified_Closed`) passes query params that the page never reads. Page initializes `statusFilter` to `'all'` via `useState('all')` — needs `useSearchParams` to sync initial state from URL. | High | 2026-06-26 | 🟩 COMPLETED |
| BUG-003 | Timesheets | `TimesheetReviewPage.tsx` | No status filter exists on the timesheet review queue. Reviewer cannot filter timesheets by `Submitted`, `Approved`, `Rejected`, or `Draft` status. Either a filter component was removed during B13 design system changes or was never added. | Medium | 2026-06-26 | 🟩 COMPLETED |
| BUG-004 | Timesheets | `TimesheetListPage.tsx` | (Mobile contractor page) No status filter exists. Contractor cannot filter their own timesheets by status. | Low | 2026-06-26 | 🟩 COMPLETED |
| FEAT-001 | Global | All list/table pages | All lists and tables should have search (text/term filtering) and relevant sort options (column-based ascending/descending). Currently: InspectionListPage, RemediationQueuePage, TimesheetReviewPage, TimesheetListPage, ClientListPage, UserListPage, AdminDashboard, ReviewerDashboard, and all Register pages lack search/sort capabilities. | Medium | 2026-06-26 | 🟩 COMPLETED |
| BUG-005 | Global | Mock data architecture | `Inspection` and `Timesheet` types lack `client_id` field. Mock data records have no client scoping. Pages don't subscribe to `authStore` client changes via `subscribe()`. When admin switches client, table data doesn't refresh because: (a) no `client_id` exists on the data models, (b) mock services don't filter by client, (c) pages don't re-fetch on client change. Affects TimesheetReviewPage, InspectionListPage, RemediationQueuePage, and any data-display page. Fix requires: add `client_id` to types, add client-scoped mock data, subscribe to client changes in pages. | High | 2026-06-26 | 🟩 COMPLETED |
| | CONTRACTOR-001 | Auth | Global | Contractor auto-logout on 403 — `queryClientErrorHandler` treated 403 as logout; `TenantContextBadge` hit admin-only `/clients`; `registerRouter` and `timesheetsRouter` blocked Contractor role | High | 2026-07-07 | 🟩 COMPLETED | | | | | | | |
| FIX-010 | Taxonomy | `GET /api/v1/taxonomy` | Contractor users hit 403 because `picklistsRouter`'s `requireRole('Admin', 'Reviewer')` middleware mounted before `taxonomyRouter` at same prefix `/api/v1` — Express matched the restrictive middleware first and rejected Contractor requests before reaching the taxonomy handler | High | 2026-07-08 | 🟩 COMPLETED | | | | | | | |
| FIX-011 | Deficiencies | `createDeficiency` INSERT | `POST /api/v1/inspections/:id/deficiencies` returned 500 because INSERT references columns (`structure_id`, `created_by`, `priority_tier`, `location_desc`) that don't exist in `deficiency_records` table. Fix: migration adds the four missing columns and makes old v2 required columns (`component`, `severity`, `probability`, `consequences`) nullable (replaced by Glencore grid in TAX-611) | High | 2026-07-08 | 🟩 COMPLETED | | | | | | | |
| ~~BUG-006~~ | Admin | `UserEditDrawer` + `DeactivateDialog` | Backdrop overlay used `bg-black/20` causing ghosting effect. **FIXED**: reduced to `bg-black/5`, added sticky header/footer, shadow-2xl, border-l to UserEditDrawer. | High | 2026-06-26 | 🟩 COMPLETED |
| CONN-7 | Inspections | NewInspectionPage / InspectionDetailPage / mockInspection | Inspection creation under Register with multi-structure support; read-only detail page with Approve/Return actions; batch create in mock service | High | 2026-06-28 | 🟩 COMPLETED |
